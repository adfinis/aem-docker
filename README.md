## docker-compose

Use docker-compose to create the author and publisher images if they do not already exist and implement the containers.

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

This error indicates that port 80 already in use
```
ERROR: for dispatcher  Cannot start service dispatcher: b'driver failed programming external connectivity on endpoint docker_dispatcher_1 (ID): Error starting userland proxy: Bind for 0.0.0.0:80: unexpected error Permission denied'
ERROR: Encountered errors while bringing up the project.
```
For example, stop the services using port 80 in Windows
CMD (as administrator)
```
net stop was
```

Use `docker stop` [CONTAINER ID] instead of `docker-compose down` if you do not want to lose any changes made. `docker start` [CONTAINER ID] to continue where you left off.


> Create a new image from a containerâ€™s changes

For example, after installing a service pack from Adobe to upgrade AEM

```
docker commit [CONTAINER ID] aem-author:6.3.2
```
